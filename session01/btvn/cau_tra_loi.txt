1. how to check variable`s type?

we can use a python's function callled type()
examples:
>>>  type("book")
>>>  type(123)
>>>  type(10.5)


2.In what cases, you will get SyntaxError from the compiler telling you 
that some of your variables have invalid names? Can you give 3 different 
examples of invalid names?

we will get syntaxerror from the compiler if
-variable name does not begin with a letter
-variable name contains an illegal chracter
-variable name is one of python keywords or funtions
examples:
>>>  4fun = "troll"
>>> op@# = "money"
>>> return = 250
